# Daily Calisthenics Brand Guidelines

## Brand Name

**Daily Calisthenics** (plural)

Use this consistently across all copy, UI, and communications.

## Voice & Tone

### Core Principle: Calm Confidence

The brand speaks with quiet authority. Observational, not motivational. We state truths without hype or fear tactics.

### Tone Attributes

- **Observational** — State facts, not threats
- **Compassionate** — Acknowledge struggle without exploiting it
- **Restrained** — Less is more; avoid superlatives
- **Practical** — Focus on what works, not promises

### Words We Use

| Prefer | Avoid |
|--------|-------|
| practice | workout |
| session | workout |
| daily practice | daily calisthenics routine |
| restores | fights back |
| builds | transforms |
| consistency | motivation |
| begin | start now |

### Framing

- **Habit over intensity** — Consistency beats occasional intensity
- **Practice over workout** — This is a daily practice, not a fitness program
- **Daily over occasional** — Small daily effort compounds

## Copy Guidelines

### Pain Points

When addressing user pain points:

- **Do** describe the problem clearly and factually
- **Do** use cause-and-effect language
- **Don't** escalate fear or use threatening language
- **Don't** use phrases like "It only gets worse" or "costs thousands"

**Good:** "When movement disappears, muscles weaken. Posture slowly adapts."

**Avoid:** "Every day you don't address it, your muscles get weaker... chronic pain that costs thousands."

### Headlines

Keep headlines calm and direct:

- **Good:** "Neglect compounds"
- **Good:** "A daily habit that restores balance"
- **Avoid:** "It only gets worse"
- **Avoid:** "A daily habit that fights back"

### CTAs

Align with "practice" language:

- **Good:** "Begin", "Begin Your First Session", "Start Today's Practice"
- **Avoid:** "Start Your First Workout", "Get Shredded"

## Visual Guidelines

### Emojis

Do not use emojis in the UI or marketing copy. They signal "gamified fitness app" which conflicts with our calm, practice-oriented brand.

Use SVG icons instead for visual interest.

### Color Palette

- Primary: Indigo (`indigo-600`)
- Background: Gray 900/950
- Text: White, Gray 300/400
- Accent for stats/warnings: Red 400 (used sparingly)

## Example Copy

### Hero (Reference)

> Sitting creates tension.
> Humans need to move.
>
> This app helps you practice movement every day.

This is the brand voice distilled. Don't change the first two lines.

### Feature Descriptions

Keep them practical and brief:

> "Just hit start. The app guides you through each exercise and rest. No thinking required."

### Footer

> Built by a software engineer who got tired of back pain.

Human, humble, credible. This stays.
